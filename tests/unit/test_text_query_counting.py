"""
How a term written again at once is counted on each SQL store (drivine4j#607): Postgres and SQLite hold to the character
after it without taking it, and Oracle, whose expressions don't look ahead, counts it ending where its last word does,
less those a word goes on from; or, where an occurrence may begin inside another, in the text with each character
between words written twice. Each case is counted both ways, through the expressions SQLite reads, as drivine4j's
TextQueryTest counts them through Java's.
